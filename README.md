<h3>About the project:</h3>

My angel with this projet is to both combine it with school and to use my knowledge to create a basic step by step page in the sale process when selling your apartment or house. I'm currently working as a broker and I figured that I could put my knowledge to use at my workplace also.

<h3>The project consits of:</h3>
<ul>
<li>index.html is the main file where all the content is.</li>
<li>main.css: This is my own stylesheet for the project and whats controling the overall layout.</li>
<li>minjs.js: This is the file with my different javaScript and jQuery script is.</li>
<li>JavaScript: I have used javascript to build a slider, I also used the "onClick" function to change the content depending on wicht button you press. With JS I also created a simple validation script for my contact form.</li>
<li>jQuery: I have used jQuery for DOM manipulation. I used the function to slide in and out differens content. I have also used it to manipulate the css for all the "p" tags so when you mouseover them the color changes to red.</li>
<li>Bootstrap: I have worked with the grid system to get the page to be responsive, I have also used the build in style for nav-bar and buttons.</li>
</ul>

I chose to make this site a "desktop first" with bootstrap it's also adjusted for both mobile and tablet devices.
I'm satisfied with what I have created.
What I would want to improve is:
The JS onClick funktion in the "Marknadsf√∂ring" section. In this section I have a "ul" element with a couple of lists that changes depending on wich button you press. In my code I have put the "ul" element inside my javascript just to get it to work. I would have wanted a function fadedin the "ul" from the HTML file when pressing a button, when pressing another one the "ul" should fadeout and be replaced with another "ul"
My validaiton for the form isn't that advanced.

Enjoy my project!
